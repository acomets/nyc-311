Clustering of neighborhood typology on NYC 311 data.

This project is inspired from the work in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186314) [1].

# Data set
The data used for this project the [NYC 311 Service Requests Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) made available through [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/nyc-311).
